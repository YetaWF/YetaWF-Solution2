Overview
========

YetaWF (pronounced "Yet Another Web Framework") is a new open source product, developed by [Mike van der Meulen](http://mikevdm.com) ([Softel vdm, Inc.](https://softelvdm.com)).  
It was used to develop and host the company's [own site](https://softelvdm.com), the [LinksWithPics service](https://linkswithpics.com), the WEO Report service (now discontinued), and various other sites.

It builds on ASP.NET Core MVC (also available using ASP.NET 4 MVC 5) to create a web framework for developers. 

YetaWF offers [Single Page Sites](https://YetaWF.com/Documentation/YetaWF/Topic/g_doc_unifiedpagesets) "out of the box" (every site is a single page site) and [Static Pages](https://YetaWF.com/Documentation/YetaWF/Topic/g_doc_staticpages).

While it has many attributes commonly found in today's CMS like DotNetNuke, Umbraco, Drupal, etc., it instead focuses on rapid application development.
Tightly integrating with Visual Studio 2015, 2017, it lends itself to rapid module development, offering built-in BREAD (Browse, Read, Edit, Add, Delete) module generation, taking advantage of ASP.NET Core MVC, Data Annotation, Templated Helpers, UIHint and many other innovative features made possible by ASP.NET Core MVC. 
Rather than being all things to all people, it narrowly focuses on offering 100% of the features that will satisfy most average websites and offers a platform for rapid custom development.

Of course, it makes extensive use of jQuery, jQuery-UI, Ajax and many client-side plugins (like grids, menus, syntax highlighter, lightbox, CKEditor, tabs, overlays and many more). 
It combines these with automatic features like JavaScript and CSS minifier and bundling, http response compression (take a look at the source for [this page](https://YetaWF.com)) without burdening the developer with administrative tasks.

For the site administrator, it offers site management, automated backups, easy version upgrades, scheduled tasks and of course complete control over user/role authorizations.

YetaWF also takes a new approach to localization by being designed from the ground up with localization in mind (again, without burdening the developer with administrative tasks). Pages, modules, down to SQL tables or file data are fully localizable. 
Adding/removing languages is possible at any time, not just at design-time.
